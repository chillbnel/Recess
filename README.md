# Recess

401 Final Project by Jeff Weng, Richard Jimmenz, Carlos Cadena and Brian Nelson

## DESCRIPTION

Our team created a site that enables people to post competitive or cooperative oriented events to our site in hopes of finding partners or opponents.  Users are able to post events, search for events, post results, view profiles of other users, chat potential participants on an event message board, and chat directly with each other.

## WORK PLAN

We worked on project tasks by itemizing “to-dos” on the Azure DevOps project management tool. We worked through a combination of individual, pair, and mob programming. Throughout project week, we alternated between partners so each team member had an opportunity to learn from their peers and continue to experience the dynamics of working within a team of unique individuals. Each member was assigned User Stories on Azure DevOps and will be responsible for developing associated tasks.   

## GIT PROCESS

Our Git Flow required each member to check out new branches for each individual User Story.
When a pull request was made, it was the responsibility of a teammate to review, then merge the branch. 
In order to minimize merge conflicts, our team worked on a beta branch that was checked out for MVP and Stretch Goals.
